# Ableton Live Project Template

This template has been created by the collective and should be used as the starting point for all new collaborations.

If you don't have Ableton Live installed you can [sign up for a free 90 day trial](https://www.ableton.com/en/trial/).

## Instillation

Download the latest release [here](https://github.com/thekeypals/ableton-live-project-template/blob/main/v0.1.als).

After downloading the file:

1. Double-click the downloaded file to open it in Ableton Live.
2. Install the template as the default set by selecting File > Save Live Set as Default Set or right-clicking on it in Live's Browser under Templates and selecting Set Default Live Set.

## Usage

Liveâ€™s Info View appears in the bottom left hand corner of your DAW and tells you the name and function of whatever you place the mouse over.

If needed use the shortcut `Shift` + `?` to show Info View.

For any custom items that have been added to the template we've created our own instructional text and it will appear in this same window.
